Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when they include a subset of ages 85-100+ because populations are not"
"available for those ages. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#Ages 85-100."

"3. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"4. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"

"5. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
