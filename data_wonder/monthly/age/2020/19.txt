Caveats:
"1. Population and rates are labeled 'Not Applicable' when Autopsy, Place of Death, Weekday or Month are grouped by or limited,"
"due to lack of a valid population. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd.html#NotApplicableRates."
"2. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"

"4. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
